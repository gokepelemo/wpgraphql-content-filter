# WPGraphQL Content Filter Plugin

A WordPress plugin that filters and sanitizes content in WPGraphQL and REST API responses based on configurable settings. Multisite-compatible, enabling a site administrator to create default settings, and for those settings to be overriden on a site level.

Created with the Claude 4 Sonnet LLM.

## Features

- **Multiple Filter Modes:**
  - None (no filtering)
  - Strip All HTML (convert to plain text)
  - Convert to Markdown
  - Custom Allowed Tags

- **Configurable Options:**
  - Apply filtering to content and/or excerpt fields
  - Preserve line breaks when stripping HTML
  - Selective Markdown conversion (headings, links, lists, emphasis)
  - Custom allowed HTML tags

- **API Integration:**
  - Automatically works with all post types registered with WPGraphQL
  - Works with WordPress REST API for all public post types
  - Filters the main `content` field in place
  - Filters the `excerpt` field (optional)
  - Supports custom post types out of the box

2. Upload the plugin files to `/wp-content/plugins/wpgraphql-content-filter/` directory
3. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/gokepelemo/wpgraphql-content-filter.git
   ```

2. Copy to your WordPress plugins directory
3. Activate and configure as above

## Requirements

- WordPress 5.0+
- PHP 7.4+
- WPGraphQL plugin (for GraphQL filtering)
- Custom post types must be registered with WPGraphQL to be filtered in GraphQL (REST API works with all public post types)

## Usage

### Admin Configuration

Navigate to **Settings > GraphQL Content Filter** in your WordPress admin to configure:

1. **Filter Mode**: Choose how to process content
2. **Apply to Fields**: Select which fields to filter
3. **Markdown Options**: Configure Markdown conversion (when applicable)
4. **Custom Tags**: Define allowed HTML tags (for custom mode)

### API Queries

The plugin filters content in place, so your existing queries work without changes. It works with both GraphQL and REST API:

#### GraphQL (requires WPGraphQL plugin)

```graphql
query GetContent {
  # Regular posts
  posts {
    nodes {
      id
      title
      content      # Filtered based on plugin settings
      excerpt      # Filtered if enabled in settings
    }
  }
  
  # Custom post types (example: products)
  products {
    nodes {
      id
      title
      content      # Also filtered based on plugin settings
      excerpt      # Also filtered if enabled
    }
  }
}
```

#### REST API

```bash
# Get posts via REST API (content will be filtered)
GET /wp-json/wp/v2/posts

# Get custom post type via REST API (content will be filtered)
GET /wp-json/wp/v2/products

# Response structure (filtered content):
{
  "id": 123,
  "title": {"rendered": "Post Title"},
  "content": {"rendered": "Filtered content here..."},  # Filtered
  "excerpt": {"rendered": "Filtered excerpt..."}        # Filtered if enabled
}
```

## Filter Modes

### Strip All HTML

Removes all HTML tags and returns plain text:

```html
<p>Hello <strong>world</strong>!</p>
â†“
Hello world!
```

### Convert to Markdown

Converts HTML to Markdown syntax:

```html
<h2>Title</h2><p>Hello <strong>world</strong>!</p>
â†“
## Title

Hello **world**!
```

### Custom Allowed Tags

Only allows specified HTML tags:

```html
Settings: p,strong,em
<p>Hello <strong>world</strong>! <script>alert('x')</script></p>
â†“
<p>Hello <strong>world</strong>! alert('x')</p>
```

## Advanced Usage

### Plugin Architecture

The plugin uses a modular architecture with separated concerns:

**Content Filtering Layer:**

- `filter_field_content()` - Universal content filtering logic
- `apply_filter()` - Core filtering implementation with mode switching
- Individual filtering methods for each mode (strip tags, markdown, etc.)

**API Hook Layer:**

- `register_graphql_hooks()` - Sets up GraphQL field filters
- `register_rest_hooks()` - Sets up REST API response filters
- Separate filter methods for each API (`filter_content`, `filter_excerpt`, `filter_rest_response`)

This separation makes the plugin easily extensible for additional APIs or filtering modes.

### Custom Post Type Support

The plugin automatically detects and filters content for:

**GraphQL**: All post types registered with WPGraphQL  
**REST API**: All public post types (built-in WordPress functionality)

No additional configuration is needed - if your custom post type is public or registered with GraphQL, the content filtering will be applied.

**Example custom post types that work:**

- Products (WooCommerce)
- Events
- Portfolio items
- Testimonials
- Any custom post type with `public => true` (REST API) or `show_in_graphql => true` (GraphQL)

### REST API vs GraphQL

The plugin works slightly differently for each API:

- **REST API**: Filters all public post types automatically
- **GraphQL**: Only filters post types explicitly registered with WPGraphQL
- **Settings**: Same filtering options apply to both APIs
- **Fields**: Both APIs filter `content` and `excerpt` fields

### Programmatic Filtering

You can also filter content programmatically:

```php
// Get the plugin instance
$filter = WPGraphQL_Content_Filter::getInstance();

// Apply custom filtering
add_filter('graphql_post_object_content', function($content, $post, $context) {
    if ($post->post_type === 'custom_post_type') {
        // Custom filtering logic here
        return wp_strip_all_tags($content);
    }
    return $content;
}, 5, 3); // Priority 5 to run before the plugin's filter
```

### Conditional Filtering

You can apply different filters based on context:

```php
add_filter('wpgraphql_content_filter_options', function($options) {
    // Change filter mode based on user role or other conditions
    if (current_user_can('edit_posts')) {
        $options['filter_mode'] = 'none'; // No filtering for editors
    }
    return $options;
});
```
