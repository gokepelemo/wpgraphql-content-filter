# feat: Major admin interface overhaul and conditional UI improvements

## 🎯 Overview
Complete redesign of the admin interface with responsive layouts, conditional field display, comprehensive network settings, and improved user experience.

## ✨ New Features

### Conditional Markdown Options Display
- **Dynamic UI**: Markdown-related options (preserve_line_breaks, convert_headings, convert_links, convert_lists, convert_emphasis) now only appear when "Convert to Markdown" filter mode is selected
- **JavaScript Integration**: Real-time show/hide functionality when filter mode changes
- **Both Contexts**: Works in both site-level and network-level admin interfaces
- **Improved UX**: Cleaner interface with relevant options displayed contextually

### Complete Network Settings Parity
- **Full Coverage**: All site-level settings now available at network level
- **Added Settings**: apply_to_excerpt, preserve_line_breaks, convert_headings, convert_links, convert_lists, convert_emphasis, cache_ttl, batch_size
- **Network Enforcement**: Complete override system for multisite environments
- **Bulk Management**: Network administrators have full control over all plugin settings

### Responsive Admin Layout
- **Modern Design**: Implemented responsive CSS Grid/Flexbox layout
- **Optimal Sizing**: Form fields use appropriate widths (300-320px) instead of stretching excessively
- **Breakpoint Support**: Responsive design for desktop (>1024px), tablet (768-1024px), and mobile (<768px)
- **Professional Styling**: Enhanced typography, spacing, and visual hierarchy

## 🔧 Technical Improvements

### Admin Interface Architecture
- **Field Registration**: Updated WordPress Settings API integration with conditional callbacks
- **CSS Framework**: Comprehensive responsive stylesheet with modern design patterns
- **JavaScript Enhancement**: Dynamic form field visibility management
- **Accessibility**: Improved focus states and form element relationships

### Memory Management Resolution
- **Performance**: Resolved PHP memory exhaustion issues through systematic optimization
- **Conditional Loading**: Implemented on-demand module initialization
- **Hook Optimization**: Streamlined GraphQL and REST API hook registration
- **Cache Management**: Efficient memory usage patterns throughout the codebase

### Release Process Improvements
- **Package Naming**: Updated release.sh to create "v2.0.x.zip" instead of full plugin name
- **Menu Labels**: Changed admin menu from "Content Filter" to "GraphQL Content Filter"
- **Version Management**: Improved release validation and GitHub integration

## 🎨 UI/UX Enhancements

### Visual Design
- **Typography**: Increased form label font size to 15px for better readability
- **Alignment**: Improved vertical and horizontal alignment throughout interface
- **Spacing**: Consistent 15px gaps and padding for professional appearance
- **Color Scheme**: Enhanced contrast and visual hierarchy

### Form Layout
- **Grid System**: Flexbox-based responsive layout with proper proportions
- **Field Sizing**: Optimal input field dimensions (25% labels, 75% fields)
- **Section Organization**: Clear visual separation between settings groups
- **Mobile Friendly**: Graceful degradation to single-column layout on small screens

### Conditional Display Logic
- **Smart Hiding**: Form rows completely hidden/shown (both labels and fields)
- **JavaScript Powered**: Real-time updates without page refresh
- **Server-side Rendering**: Proper initial state based on current settings
- **Cross-context**: Consistent behavior in site and network admin

## 🛠️ Code Quality

### Architecture
- **Separation of Concerns**: Clean separation between admin, core, and hook classes
- **WordPress Standards**: Full compliance with WordPress coding standards
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error management and user feedback
- **Security**: Proper nonce verification and capability checks

### Maintainability
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive inline documentation and comments
- **Modularity**: Well-organized class structure with clear responsibilities
- **Extensibility**: Framework for future conditional field additions
- **Testing**: Systematic debugging and validation process
